# Guess my Number 🤔

"Guess My Number" is a classic guessing game where the code sets up a number within a specified range, and we need to try to guess it within a limited number of attempts. 

Through strategic questioning and deduction, we aim to narrow down the possibilities until we correctly identify the secret number.

## Fun Fact ✍️

This project started when my friend and I wanted to play the game irl, but we got bored. So, we decided to solve the same problem by writing code instead. 😂
